# Palak's System-Design Course

An interactive system-design course: **42 chapters** across five levels, each with animated
diagrams, live simulators, a "common mistakes" box, an interview drill and a 5-question quiz —
plus a 174-term glossary, a spaced-repetition flashcard deck and a timed mock-interview room.

No build step, no dependencies, no server, no account. Progress is saved in your browser.

## Get the app

### Option 1 — one file, offline (recommended)

**[⬇ Download `system-design-course.html`](https://github.com/CaptainBlue793/palaks-system-design-course/releases/latest/download/system-design-course.html)** (~2 MB)

Double-click it. The whole course opens in your browser and runs completely offline — every
chapter, simulator, quiz and study tool is inside that single file. Nothing is installed,
nothing phones home. Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.

Keep it on a USB stick, email it to a friend, read it on a plane.

### Option 2 — read it online

**<https://captainblue793.github.io/palaks-system-design-course/>**

### Option 3 — run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaptainBlue793/palaks-system-design-course.git
cd palaks-system-design-course
```

Open `index.html` in any browser. That's the whole setup.

  style.css             design system, light + dark themes
  study-data.js         generated: search index + flashcard deck
build.js                bundles everything into the single-file edition
src/router.js           hash router used only by the single-file build
dist/                   build output: system-design-course.html
```

## Building the single-file edition

```bash
node build.js        # -> dist/system-design-course.html
```

Requires Node (any recent version) and nothing else — no `npm install`, no dependencies.

The bundler inlines the stylesheet, the runtime and every page's markup, styles and scripts into
one document, then adds a small hash router (`src/router.js`) that swaps pages in and out of
`<body>` and re-runs the shared runtime, so each page boots exactly as it does when served as its
own file. It asserts on the three places the runtime hard-codes multi-file navigation, so if those
lines ever change the build fails loudly instead of shipping a broken bundle.

Re-run it after editing any chapter. If you change the quizzes or headings, regenerate
`assets/study-data.js` first so search and flashcards stay in sync.

## Contributing a chapter

- Register it in `CHAPTERS` in `assets/app.js`; the filename number, the `data-chapter`
  attribute and the hero `Chapter N` pill must all agree.
- Reuse the shared classes (`panel`, `stepper`, `diagram`, `stat`, `callout`, `quiz`) instead of
  adding new CSS.
- Keep 5 quiz questions per chapter — the flashcard deck is generated from them.
